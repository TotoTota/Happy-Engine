# What is Happy Engine

Happy Engine is a game engine that supports 2d and 3d graphis, The engine uses C# to code game logic, This engine started with the cherno's
game engine series.

# What Did I change from the cherno's game engine series

I added 3d support to the engine, an audio system because that's one of the main part of games, I added an export button to export your game
and make a release.
